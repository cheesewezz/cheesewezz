If you see me listening to Black Hole Sun, please tally up the points /j

I really *MOSTLY* like rock music, however, I tend to like everything except present day country. I'd rather prefer oldies

# First of all, where are my manners?

I go by many names, which is why you should check out my pronouns page just in case! I'd rather prefer if you call me zxioide, zvi, BHS (Black Hole Sun), or just kin.

I am a male individual; he him pronouns are preferred. If mistaken, I don't mind.
>I DO MIND ACTUALLY! I'm kidding

My entire live, I've been an artist. Traditional, Digital, and making art from literal cardboard.

>Black Hole Sun Information. Black hole sun is a humanoid dragon inspired by the song Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden. However, his name is also Blaholik, a guardian of Black Holes, Solar eclipses, and Worm holes. He has both an actual dragon form, human form, and mid both dragon and human. His dragon form is as big as the sun, and his dragon humanoid form is as tall as a regular tree. When you want to picture the thought of Blaholik's actual dragon form, just think of the dragon from Legend Of Zelda, dinraal. Blaholik is just some random made up god like name to make him sound more powerful.

# Now, before you go

1. Please whisper me first if any issues, conflicts, or drauma leaks through the threads. I handle personal matters in private to not drive panic amongst the others in Pony Town. If it is an emergency, you may ask for my Discord, and only for that reason only.
2. I do NOT use tone tags that commonly. If you would rather prefer me to use tone tags, please ask ahead so I know, I can't read your mind.
3. You can crown me in whispers, however only in whispers depending if I'm not offtab.

4 I do not tolerate, or encourage you to put inapropriate comments, or art on any of my social medias. Not that it hasn't happened yet, but just to get you aware. 

5. finally, do not interact critera stands, I stand by it, so you should as well.

   # Thank you for your time, there should be more information in my patreon, since I really HATE working on githubs.
