<h5 align="center"> I'm always listening to music, so now you'll be able to see what I'm listening to now, haha. I really love music. Music is my love language. I love mostly rock music, but I explore different genre's and love a few, except country and things like Taylor Swift.</h5>

<h6 align="center"> if you would like to recommend me music, please do!</h6>

<h5 align="center"> I am of male origin, I just go by the usual he/him pronouns. I don't care if you mistaken my gender by accident, I'll just playfully act offended and carry on.


for nicknames, you can call me John, zxioide, cheese, or quite literally bhs (as I am quite known for my Black Hole Sun pony character) I will be linking a [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@scarface) to further show what you can call me and my preferences, which are also in my Patreon if the link is not here yet.


I am mentally unstable. Sometimes I may act like I'm irritated, aggressive, or just at a very low point (to which I have to go offline for an extended period) I promise I'm fine, I just need time to myself, which is why I'm sort of hardly ever online to take care of my mental health.


I am MOSTLY chronically online, but I'm also busy and always offtab in game. I'm around 10AM to 12AM. If I am up far later than I either am distracted or I problably don't care about the blue light burning my retinas.

| `Known` | I block freely, I don't care who you are to a certain degree, but I do have standards. Don't break them. |
| `Unforeseen` | if you want to see some specifics on this topic, I suggest you check out my *patreon* and scroll down until you find DO NOT INTERACTS |

*I also may add that I do not want friends that I have made clear I didn't wish to be in my life, whether for personal reasons or much more.*

<h5 align="center"> This is the last of my about me, I just wanted to keep this short since I KNOW not a lot of people would read, "allat"

1. If there are any personal issues or issues that need to be addressed to me and me alone, please talk to me privately, only then will I give you my Discord so that we can discuss elsewhere and not make Pony Town problematic as it already is itself.
   
2. I prefer if you'd whisper me if you are going to crown me or compliment me since I'm normally not on tab. If it is obvious that I am on tab then go crazy, otherwise go crazy in my whispers.
   
3. I do not approve of innapropriate or harrassment on my strawpage/atabook. If you have an issue with me then I suggest you take your sorry ass elsewhere respectfully so.
   
4. I DONT LEND OUT MY SUPPORTER!
   
5. I am a red dead geek, or so, a John Marston wannabe. If you're a rdr(2) fan, I will come for you and lather you in compliments and a bit of fanboying. I like making stupid red dead redemption references so if I see you I might just say, "ITS JOHN MARSTON MICAH!" (depending on who you are).
