| Dni's | the prefers and the interaction information |
| --- | --- |
| `Known` | I have basic do not interact critera, I think it's better *known* that you know for preference who I want to socialize with |
| `Unforeseen` | if you want to see some specifics on this topic, I suggest you check out my *patreon* and scroll down until you find DO NOT INTERACTS |

*I also may add that I do not want friends that I have made clear I didn't wish to be in my life, whether for personal reasons or much more.*

I indulge in a bunch of music, but I *mainly* listen to guitar related music. Rock, grudge, and all of that stuff, except country. I hate country.

If you see me listening to a specific band that alligns my Pony Town skin, you should put it on a counter since music is my biggest inspiration for my creations /silly

I am a male individual and go by the standard he/him pronouns. If you don't really know me and mistaken my pronouns I won't take it to offense, but I will act offended humorously. I have a case of insomniaosis and a depressed mental (I lack of despondency), If I act out of my place or have been aggressive pay no heed to my behavior. All I need is some time and solace.

I'm normally chronically online, but as of 2025 I have not been as active as much as I've been before of last year. But I swear I won't be coming out every blood moon, smh.
[I *was* known for doing anonymous questions and opinions as a dragon: Black hole sun oc. If I stay home on week days thats when I host them, on weekeneds it's probably a slight chance of them happening]

Speaking of busyness, I am normally online (if I choose to be) around **10 AM to 12 AM**, If I am up later or past 12 then I am either distracted or just chilling without noticing my end of burning blue light in my eyes.

on that note, I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT NICKNAMES, GAH!

Feel free to call me a various kind of nicknames if you're close. If you have just met me just call me zxioide, kino/kinorino, or just literally Black Hole Sun.

I guess that's it, I intended this to be short since I know a majority of you won't read all of it. I just would like to add a few more things and put more things down before I take my leave.
1. If there are any issues that need to be brought to my attention please ask me and talk to me privately, I will also ONLY then give out my discord so we could discuss on the matter without making pony town more problematic as it already is.

3. I prefer if you whisper me if you have any compliments or crowns if I'm not on tab. If I AM on tab, then go crazy!
4. I mainly post art on Patreon and Bluesky, for there should not be anywhere else where my art is posted (might be posting a tumblr blog soon). If you spot my art on another platform that isn't from a user that alligns to my own please let me know.
5. I am a big RDR fan, if you walk around with a RDR oc or character I'm going to chase after you and strangle you /pos
6. I do not lend out my supporter.
