* I am a sucker for music, you'll never catch me not listening to music (that is unless I'm asleep), though, I enjoy music as it is my love language and love a lot of genre's but mostly rock, opera, and slow calming music.
 if you'd like to recommend me music, please do!

I go by many names such as **john (marston), scarface, cheesewezz, or black hole sun** (which is an old name I went by but usually don't anymore) however, if you're a stranger and don't know which name to chose from just call me **john** for short. If you're a *close friend* you can call me whatever you please. Run it by me first before calling me anything offensive though. 
> I am a **male individual**, I go by the standard **he/him** and thats it really. Of course I won't be offended if you assume something else, only jokingly will I yell at you about it. I mean no ill will

I block people freely despite having a bit of standards. As long as you're chill and don't indulge in problematic things (involving minors) otherwise **im sending you straight to hell**
> you want to know about my standards? check my patreon and scroll down to "STANDARDS"

I am mentally unstable, I tend to ignore people, go silent, or avoid others with all of the above. I normally jump back into reality after a while, but if I am hadn't it's best to interact with caution. I have insomnia, and a reeking depression 

> I also tend to flirt with people unconciously *NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF A ROMANTIC ATTRACTION* (unless stated otherwise), only for the purpose of teasing or making fun of in a light hearted way. I flirt with friends only and if you're not comfortable with me doing so I will abide and not continue.
