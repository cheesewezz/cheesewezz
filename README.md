you can see what I'm listening to! I mostly like rock music (divorced dad rock mostly) but I also like exploring genres like jeff buckley, The Smiths, and Pecos Hank. Of course there are more bands I really love, but fitting them into this box may take several hours.

 If you'd like to recommend me music please do! music is my love language!

You can call me john marston, cheesewezz, or zxioide. I'm also known as black hole sun, but that name hasn't been spoken in a few days. Friends that are considered VERY close may call me whatever they want, seriously, just run it by me first before you call me something offensive/j

I am of male origin, I go by he/him pretty much. I don't mind if you don't know who I am right away, I just will act JOKINGLY offended, I swear I don't mean any ill will.

I am mentally unwell, I may act very down, angry, or quiet certain times. I promise I'm fine, I usually bounce back after taking a break, but normally I may not just so you may be aware. I have depression and a wacky insomnia demon

 *I am also extremely flirty as a tease, or in a joking manner. I promise I don't mean it seriously and if you aren't comfortable with me joking like that I won't do it. You have my word.*

 I am a HUGE red dead fan (can you tell?) I enjoy talking about red dead and making stupid references from the game or videos. If I see you running around with a red dead character/oc im going to jump you and strangle you with every fiber of my body /pos

I am a ameteur artist. I go both ways, digitally and traditionally. I prefer traditionally more since I suck at digital

lastly I do have *do not interact standards*, but I block freely. Don't take it for granted. Check out my [patreon](patreon.com/user?u=85089921) and check out my dni's

1. if you have any personal issues that need to be brought to my attention please reach out to me in whispers. I will then give you my discord so we can talk privately because I prefer not making pony town more problematic as it already is. If my whispers are not available you can leave me a message in either my [ata.book] or [strawpage] if you need to talk.

2. I do not tolerate inappropriate behavior, or harassment on any of my media's. If you have a problem with me please take your sorry ass somewhere else.

3. If you want to crown me or compliment my ponies I prefer if you whisper me since I'm always not on tab or afk. IF THEY ARE STILL DISABLED JUST GO CRAZY IN PUBLIC. I might see it if I'm looking at the right time.

4. I am active around __10AM to 12AM__ at midnight. I am up far later, later than you might think. If I'm not online I promise I'm active somewhere else. On weekdays I may not be available at all depending on the day

5. No I dont lend out my supporter. Thats why I have my whispers disabled.
