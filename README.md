# Hello strangers, or maybe friends! Welcome To My Github.
perhaps I should share the same amount that is on my patreon, just a little smaller!

Here are some of the links I recommend you check out or take a gander at. There are more links at the bottom as well!

> [Patreons Home Page](https://www.patreon.com/c/user/posts?u=85089921),  [Ata.Book](https://zxioide.atabook.org/),  [Christmas Tree Signing](https://colormytree.me/2024/01JE2XWHK1YHZ7CY10Q7036SDX)

> P.S the Christmas Tree was NOT my original idea. I was inspired by an individual who I haven't got their name! So kuddos to them because it was an awesome idea!

# IDENTITY INFORMATION 01

[![spotify-github-profile](https://spotify-github-profile.kittinanx.com/api/view?uid=314lk5plcho6tynqye2qelu5zs5m&cover_image=true&theme=novatorem&show_offline=true&background_color=121212&interchange=true&bar_color=53b14f&bar_color_cover=true)](https://spotify-github-profile.kittinanx.com/api/view?uid=314lk5plcho6tynqye2qelu5zs5m&redirect=true) If you catch me listening to Black Hole Sun, count it up /joking

I really love Rock music because it's been in my life since. I still like other types of music, but not modern day country, I prefer oldies.

I am a [male](https://en.pronouns.page/@zxioide) individual. I go by the standard he/him pronouns, except I'm not *him* /j

I go by many names, but if you're a stranger feel free to call me zxioide, zwrath, or either Sabatour, or *Black Hole Sun*

> zwrath was inspired by Whittys lore how he was called *Wrath* at some point.

I am an **insomniac**, I'm normally active around 10/9 AM to 12AM, if I'm up later than that then I'm probably engaging in something else then regarding my chronically-online-self.

My mental health deteriates, and I go a little crazy at some certain times. I promise if I sound snappy or irritated it's not your fault. I just really have been having a few bad days.

I am an introvert, I actually am more wild and energetic online, but I promise you I'm a very shy dude and don't like to come talk to anybody first. If you're shy to come talk to me, don't worry, me too. <3

# Additional, and Final Information ![0010e299dfd3d4a79511b7c8c1f088ff](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8c22b1f-afb4-409a-ae5c-e991fe814713)



1. I usually don't use tone tags. If you'd like me to use them, I'd happily do it!
   
2. I stand by the DNI critera. As long as you aren't the three p's (proshipper, Predator, Pedophile), or anything worse. I'm chill with you, otherwise... **GET OUT!** My Patreon is more detailed on who I don't want interacting, or what I prefer.

3. If there is a situation where it needs to be taken privately on another social then please ask me first and give your reason. I *only* then will give you my discord so we don't have to bring anything problematic on pony town as much as pony town is already.

4. I am a red dead redemption fan. If you come close to me with a red dead redemption character/oc, or make a reference, I'm going to hunt you down and make you my friend /sillyj
