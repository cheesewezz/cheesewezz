* I am a sucker for music, you'll never catch me not listening to music (that is unless I'm asleep), though, I enjoy music as it is my love language and love a lot of genre's but mostly rock, opera, and slow calming music.
 if you'd like to recommend me music, please do!

I go by many names such as **john (marston), scarface, cheesewezz, or black hole sun** (which is an old name I went by but usually don't anymore) however, if you're a stranger and don't know which name to chose from just call me **john** for short. If you're a *close friend* you can call me whatever you please. Run it by me first before calling me anything offensive though. 
> I am a **male individual**, I go by the standard **he/him** and thats it really. Of course I won't be offended if you assume something else, only jokingly will I yell at you about it. I mean no ill will

I am IN LOVE with Red Dead Redemption (can you tell?) I make stupid references a lot and enjoy engaging in red dead lore, or things related to the game
> If I see you running around with a red dead character/oc I will immedately jump you and shower you in kisses

I am mentally unstable, I tend to ignore people, go silent, or avoid others with all of the above. I normally jump back into reality after a while, but if I hadn't it's best to interact with caution. I have insomnia, and a reeking depression 

> I also tend to flirt with people unconciously *NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF A ROMANTIC ATTRACTION* (unless stated otherwise), only for the purpose of teasing or making fun of in a light hearted way. I flirt with friends only and if you're not comfortable with me doing so I will abide and not continue.

I'm mostly online around **10AM/2AM** to midnight, I deeply disregard the negativity of screentime and I procrastinate a *LOT* though, you can catch me around docks, or in the cod area normally roaming around
> I also am most often offtab or asleep. if you need to reach out to me don't be afraid to whisper me immedately, and i'll get back to you if you're still around
