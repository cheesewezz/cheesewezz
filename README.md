I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MUSIC. I love rock music all the way down to some nostaliga. I am almost all the time listening to rock music (that sometimes corresponds to my ponies in Pony Town) I like every type of music, except I strongly don't like Taylor Swift, and I don't like modern Country, I like the old crap

If you'd like to recommend me some music I'd love to hear them!

I have a lot of nicknames, but I usually go by John, zxioide, cheese, or bhs (black hole sun) around. I mostly go by John, so choosing a nickname for me wouldn't be quite difficult 
(unless you're my *very* close friends, you can call me whatever you want *just run it by me first*)

I am a male individual, I go by the standard he/him pronouns. I don't care if you mistaken me, since (if this is the first time) you don't really know me well, but I'll playfully act offended if you do. No offense of course.

I am an ameteur artist, I do both traditional art and digital. I'm trying to master digital more, but it's a work in progress.

I am a RED DEAD geek, if I see you in any red dead character/oc ponies inspired from the game I will go crazy and chase you. I greatly indulge in red dead and may talk about it a LOT. so be aware.

I am a bit mentally unstable. I may act very irritated, aggressive, or going silent. I promise I'm fine, and nothing provoked it (I hope), normally I bounce right back but sometimes I may not. 

> sometimes I may act like a flirt, or a big tease. I mean this in the most possible joking manner. I don't mean this intentionally, and if you'd like me to stop I'd gladly abide.

I am normally online around 10AM/12AM to midnight. If I am up any later than 12AM its because im disregarding the negativity to blue light, or im speaking with my friends. Normally I'm not always on tab, and could be either away from home or sleeping. If you need to reach me don't be afraid to whisper me (if available)

<h6 align="center">just would like to clarify that old friends of mine i've made clear I didn't want in my life NEED to stay out of it. That goes out strongly.</h6>

my dni's have standards, I suggest you check out my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/user/posts?u=85089921) and scroll down until you see them. Though I may have standards, I block freely, don't take it for granted.

this will be the remaining text since I know some people don't want to know my lifestory.

1. If there are any personal issues that need to be reached to me privately please reach out and whisper me before so, I will only then give you my discord so we can take the issue off pony town since its so largely problematic.

2. I'd prefer if you'd whisper me when crowning me since I'm always offtab, or not home, OR sleeping. Though, due to countless supporter whispers I had to turn it off. So if you can you can whisper me when they are open or come up to me and go crazy.

3. I do not tolerate inappropriate behavior, or harassment on any of my media's. If you have a problem with me please take your sorry ass somewhere else.

4. I DO NOT LEND OUT MY SUPPORTER.
